# Integral-Calculator 
  Personal project from the 1st year of faculty (UTCN).
  Presents a simple integral calculator written in C.
  It also uses GNUPlot in order to show a graph of the calculated function.
    -> In order that GNUPlot will work, it must be installed. ( gnuplot folder contains all the package)
  Hope you will like it!
